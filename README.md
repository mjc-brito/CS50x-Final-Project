# CS50x-Final-Project
This repository contains my final project for the CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course offered by Harvard University. The project is a web application built using Flask framework and incorporates various software development and web programming languages covered in the course, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application is designed to serve as an random strong password generator.
## How To Use It
Enter a number between 8 and 16 in the ‘Password Length’ field and click on ‘Generate’. Your new strong and random password will appear below.
## Future Work
- Add a "copy" button (to copy the password with just one click)
